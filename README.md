# Mini-Tracker-Robot-following-the-light-spot-position
Developed a neural network-based control system for a mobile robot to track and follow a light source. The robot uses three sensors to detect light within a specific range, and the neural network processes the data to generate control signals, enabling the robot to adapt to varying light conditions and positions.
